carrier-finder

Built and used for work to check who goes to which locations in country Western Australia. Found this to be a nicer alternative than opening an xl on limited computers and searching.

Notes:
Requires google maps key if you want the map location to show when you choose a location.
List is filterable on all types
Details of carriers removed due to nature of app
